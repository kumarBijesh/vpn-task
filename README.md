README - VPN Privacy & Security Report

Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a VPN to protect online privacy and secure communication.
For this, I used Windscribe, a free and reputable VPN service.
⚙️ Tools Used

  VPN: Windscribe (free tier)
  IP Lookup & Verification: whatismyipaddress.com

📝 What I Did

  Installed Windscribe VPN client on my machine.

  Signed up for a free account and logged in.

  Connected to a VPN server (Windscribe auto-selected a location in Hong Kong).

   Verified my new IP using whatismyipaddress.com. It showed:

  IP: 146.70.250.22

  Location: Hong Kong

   Disconnected VPN and checked again, my IP reverted to India:

  IP: 27.56.159.139

  Location: Noida, India

🔐 What This Shows

  When the VPN is ON, my IP and virtual location change to Hong Kong, masking my real IP and location.

   When the VPN is OFF, my IP reverts back to India, revealing my actual ISP and location.

✅ Benefits of VPN

   Hides your real IP and physical location.

  Encrypts internet traffic, protecting data from hackers and snoopers.

   Helps access region-restricted content.

⚠️ Limitations

  Can slow down browsing speed slightly.
  Free VPNs have data limits (Windscribe gave me 2 GB free).
  Still rely on trust in the VPN provider not logging your activity.

👋 Notes

This exercise helped me understand how VPNs help protect online privacy by changing IP addresses and encrypting traffic, making it harder for third parties to track or intercept data.
